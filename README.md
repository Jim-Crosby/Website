<h1>Tip: #1</h1>
<h2>Stop, Look, Think</h2>
<p>Did anything look out of the ordinary? Did you recognize the senders address? Was it similar but not the same as an offical email?</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">HR Department &lt;company.bonus@usa.com&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h1>Tip: #2</h1>
<h2>Do you spot a red flag?</h2>
<p>Any email from an external sender should have a caution message at the very top. Do you see this banner?</p>

<p>That little message was aclue that this email came into our comapny via the internet.</p>
<p>Just take an extra second to check the senders email address. In this case it had HR Department but the actual email address was not saying that it came from Blueline as you would have expected. does it have odd spelling or grammer mistakes, that you would not expect from a litgitmate company.</p>

<h1>Tip: #3</h1>
<h2>When in doubt throw it out</h2>
<p>If you ever think that an email is suspicous it is better to err on the side of caution. Contact Brooklyn or Jim and they will be able to check it out and if necessary remove it from everyones email.</p>
<p>If you think you have clicked on something nefarious (good word that), then please don't try and hide it or not mention it as it will always comeback to bite you. Just let us know as soon as possible that way we can check, and take any remendial action, and honest that will not include slapping you on the back of the head. As these Phishing emails are designed to try and catch people out just look for the little clues.Â </p>
